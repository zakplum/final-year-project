46,"> Is potential more or less guaranteed in American sports

no, but teams generally have a good idea for how good players will be 


> is it easier to get rid of players with long contracts?

long contracts (6+ years) aren't common in the NBA/NFL but is more common in the MLB typically for the current superstars/players with superstar potential.

shedding long contracts depends on
- does the player have a no trade clause
- how many years/ how much money left
- player performance

For Boehly's baseball team, the LA Dodgers, they signed Shohei Ohtani to a 10 year, $700M deal this summer (they will pay him $2M per year for the first 10 years, $68M per year for another 10 years). Essentially  a 10 year playing contract on a 20 year payment plan",5,0

* Described where he lives as being well outside London in the north and that he only comes into the actual city about once a month but basically lives his life in the countryside. 
* It wasn't Timo Werner who he doesn't seem to like a lot to be honest, but actually Mateo Kovacic and Petr Cech who both speak fluent German that were his support group and friends. He really, really likes Petr Cech. 
* Doesn't watch any football outside of playing. Said he sort of follows Leverkusen but that he never watches or follows anything not related to where he is playing. 
* Still messages a lot of the staff like chefs (A specific Scottish chef he really likes) and hospitality people at Chelsea but because there's hardly any players or coaches or management from his time, says he feels no connection to Chelsea anymore. 
* The away dressing rooms in the PL he said are the worst he's ever seen. He said he likes the old school youth football feel and understands it's meant to make you uncomfortable, but he said it still shocks him how bad they are. 
* Was mixed on the atmopshere in English games and said it's a great feeling because if you go up a goal away, the whole ground goes quiet while in Germany it's frustrating because you can be up 3-0 and the fans will just get louder, but England has a more reactive, in tune with the standing of the game kind of crowd. Said he hears trumpets and jazz instruments sometimes from the crowd which he loves. 
* Scoring the goal in the CL final and winning the final was the first time in his career he actually really believed he was a top football player. Struggles a lot with imposter syndrome but he knows that if you score a goal in a CL final, you actually have to be somewhat good and no one can ever take that away from you. 
* That the only friends his age who are having kids are his football friends. He described himself as being financially set up for the rest of his life by age 23 and that it affords him the security of wanting kids and doing whatever he wants outside of it. 
* The three donkeys he now owns live with his parents, not him.",41,1

***Starters***

**RCB:** Fofana would be fine if he could keep fit, Disasi is a serviceable option albeit nothing extraordinary there.

**LB:** Chilwell still has his exceptional movement which is useful, we just need consistency and availability at left back - Cucurella is anonymous on the offensive side and doubtful defensively. Shame we've lost Hall and never got to explore Maatsen there (even if I had my doubts over him).

**CMs:** I'm not convinced by Caicedo - Enzo as a pairing, however they are both great on an individual level and I will reserve judgement for when a new coach comes in - Poch has used them horribly. Lavia, if he actually exists, should be able to stake a claim to start as well.

**LW:** While it feels wrong to loan out a £62m player, Mudryk desperately needs the match experience. Don't want to criticise him too much as that happens enough around here, he just looks as if he has no understanding on the pitch which makes a lot of sense. He has the physical attributes and plenty of creativity to succeed, however he just needs to learn to play the game (that is kinda important!). Sterling can play here of course, I just find him frustrating and not dependable.

**ST:** Jackson is nowhere near as bad as made out on here. Seven goals already in the league which would have equalled two of the last three seasons. His link-up play is promising, he works the defence well, just needs to develop over time without the pressure which is why I am keen on bringing in a more senior forward.

***Depth***

Mentioned some names above i.e. Disasi, Gusto, Lavia who should be serviceable and not in desperate need of replacement. Jackson and Chilwell become depth if we bring in names in their position. Chukwuemeka has been exciting. Badiashile has been shaky recently but was otherwise solid under more structure. Sanchez is fine to compete in goal if his attitude doesn't repeat itself, Bettinelli/any third choice keeper too.

I think Gallagher gets forced out, Chalobah goes too. Gilchrist is Chels but I'd suspect he goes out on loan next year. Not including them as depth for those reasons.

Aside from those, I'm not sold on the others which is a problem. You can't have just 8-9 players beyond the starting eleven - especially when that includes two goalkeepers.

Money evidently doesn't solve everything and our issues are far more deep-rooted than just the squad, but we have spent a lot and still have plenty of holes to plug. With our suspected financial situation, how are we going to do that?",1,0

there was no way to see the lavia injury coming so that gets a pass. caicedo and enzo being overpays in a non-priority positions was very predictable.

I completely agree, never disputed that. At the time I thought it was a huge overpay considering his injury record.

>jackson leading the line after how much has been spent is a clear example of bad recruitment.

Tactically, it is a headache for Poch. Caicedo, a ball winning 8, is being asked to play the role of an anchor. Enzo, a regista, is forced into a box to box role because the toothless attack needs support and the inexperienced or aging CBs are exposed when the fullbacks advanced.

And Poch knew this. Chelsea journalists are reporting that he drew a line on Caicedo's valuation much lower than what was eventually paid. But the directors where dead-set on that midfield combination and went ahead anyway. They've stockpiled second strikers with holes in other areas of the attack, Sterling is blocking the minutes of the young wingers that need to be playing, holding attacking fullbacks without the counterbalance profiles to make it work, you can go on and on.

When it's a pass they can put it anywhere they like, but as soon as they have to shoot they lose their heads.

 I told a few people to try hitting it hard and early and they started scoring so much more, until they went back to their old ways of dilly dallying, taking unnecessary touches, basically trying to get into the best possible position to score.

I can tell you as someone who later turned into a goalkeeper as well, it's so much harder to deal with.

arsenal 0-2 liverpool: arsenal were a lot better and should've been ahead really early on but they didn't know how to handle jota and we were pretty dominant after that which got us the win

It's worth saying that we were probably the better team last night from half time until we gave them a stupid goal. That's because Klopp changed the shape, dropping Jones back to sit alongside Mac Allister, and that allowed Diaz the space on the left (I have no intention of watching the game back to see if there were any other changes).

1321,How dare you?,1,1
1322,"As far as the PL goes, engagement. Outrage baiting drives clicks

With regards to LaLiga, it's hard to overstate just how incompetent the refs are, so a ton of bad decisions tend to be made",2,1

1327,Yes. What was the last team to win something big without owning the ball?,0,0
1328,"I mean 51% is technically having more possession but 2019 Liverpool in the CL win weren't really possession focused, then Chelsea had a similar number when they won it, as did Real Madrid in the 2021-22 season. I definitely wouldn't call that ""owning the ball"" and it's the biggest club trophy in the world.",1,0
1329,Well Mou's Madrid scored 121 goals in the league without the very possession focused football of today's top teams so you don't necessarily need to do it but it's the least risky way of playing positive football. You concede fewer chances overall and maintain a lot more control so this risk averse approach pays off in winning more matches in the long run,3,0

Both strikers who lack in the â€œput ball in netâ€ department but are absolutely class about just about every other aspect of striker play. Fans who watch the team every week will just â€œget themâ€ moreso than casuals.

Need to get of your own final third? Boot it up to them and they'll relieve the pressure for a bit. Need someone to constantly wear down the center backs? They're your man.

Players like that tend to be supremely underrated by casual fans who quantify striker's value by their goal contributions only. People will focus on the goal he could've scored that was cleaned up for him but not on how dominant he was when it came to occupying defenders",34,1
1334,"It's a double edged sword, when you have games like Sunday, where you're slicing up the midfield and getting some fortunate bounces, that style of play is a great addition and exactly what you need. When you're having games like Arsenal's Christmas stretch, he's a waste of space on the field. 

At least in my eyes, the striker is the guy a team turns to when the game is running against you and you need to convert some half chance BS into a goal. Havertz and Long just aren't those guys",1,1
1335,"havertz is far for class on every aspect lol. see his touch on the ""not a pen"" play. he does that often

now look for a good forward pass from him. you'll be hard press to find any. and he's being mostly a midfielder! whilst being shit at actual midfielding aspects. he's like a cdm/peter crouch hybrid in technique but playing as a attacking midfielder 

dribbling? good fucking luck. altho he did force that 2nd konate yellow, good for him!

header? he has 0 heading technique when we are talking about heading on goal, despite being the tallest on the pitch. also lost every aerial duel yesterday. only boot long that worked was that one that, again, forced a konate yellow

more like a 15m player than a 65m one, let alone being on 275k p/w

only reason some Arsenal fans ""get him"" is either due to blind love for every single player on the club, Arteta praising him so you gotta follow the manager public talk, coping that the transfer was actually 500iq or following too many tacticos on the internet that tried their best to justify the signing (using the age old argument of ""im smarter than everyone else so if you disagree with me it means you just dont understand it""). oh and he runs hard off ball! first ever to do so apparently

> People will focus on the goal he could’ve scored that was cleaned up for him but not on how dominant he was when it came to occupying defenders

He won 3 yellow cards and single handedly got Konate sent off. People will also just look at the stats and see he ""only"" won 2/12 aerial duels. But when you watch the match it was the fact he was challenging well for them which allowed us to win the 2nd balls.",22,1

Any time there is a match rescheduled they aim to fit it in a soon as possible, there are deliberately gaps in the schedule to fit these matches in, in the case of city brentford it was further delayed by brentfords FA cup replay.

To say there is an advantage to having a game in hand is absolutely absurd, every team has the same number of games played at the end of the season. They also still have to go out and earn the points from their rescheduled match.

Ya sure they may have gone illegal by crossing the limit but the rule doesn't make much sense to begin with, once you've setup the infrastructure and allowed the fancy owners in, they will find a way to speed run.

  Yes, say what you want about the comparisons between English and German crowds in the top 2 tiers but when it comes to the depths of the football pyramid then no other country even comes close to England. 

  Germany has a higher population and similar land area but only has 3 fully professional national tiers of 56 teams including some reserves clubs, the 4th tier in Germany is semi pro and heavily regionalised. 

  In England, there are no reserve teams in the pyramid and even the 5th tier outside of the Football League is national and fully professional, I know a guy that plays for a 5th tier team and he earns over Â£1,000 per week, the whole 5th tier make a living from football and don't need to have another job.
  
  Bradford City have been in the 4th tier for years and still consistently have an average attendance of nearly 20k.

  Chesterfield, Oldham and Southend have average attences of 7/8k in the 5th tier. 

  Even in the 6th tier, some teams are profesional. Scunthorpe and Yeovil have average attendances of 4k in the 6th tier. 

  You can even go down to the 7th (SEVENTH) tier of English football and Macclesfield have an average attendance of over 3000, Dulwich Hamlet have an average attendance of over 2500.

i think if hojlund played for liverpool, he probably gets about 5 less goals. neither player is clinical but nunez gets chances so easily for a reason. he would come nowhere near nunez's assist tally and he wouldn't be the threat to cbs for 90 mins that nunez is either.",4,0

Messi got a free goal because Lloris committed to his side way too early, and pretty much just let Messi pass it into the side of the goal he just moved out of and can't reach anymore. He probably was going to hit it somewhere completely different until half a second before actually taking the pen. 

Every keeper in the world would've probably dived for the second pen, although a better penalty saver could've gotten a foot in it and maybe saved it. Lloris did also dive too early again but Dybala didn't change his placement.

Paredes would've never taken that penalty if the keeper in front of him was not only a known pen saver but also hadn't dived way too early the previous 2 pens. That might just be the only time in his career where he's not cunted it right into the top corner. But it's a high risk shot, and if the keeper in front of you is bad at pens and has a very evident flaw you can exploit you're probably going to try to. He didn't dive early in that one and even guessed the side but the crappy low risk shot still went in so tbf it worked. If the keeper is Maignan though I think he takes a manlier pen (or, although not as likely, it goes outside the stadium). 

Nothing Lloris could've done about Montiel's, that's just a normal penalty and he (or way more likely, the gk coaching staff, so Maignan would've almost certainly picked the same side) picked the wrong side

Assuming all the French penalties went the same way I think we'd have probably still won but nonetheless Maignan would've definitely given France a decent chance",2,1

Lloris let himself get psyched into diving early.

Lee Johnson- One of the worst managers I've ever seen to consistently somehow keep defrauding clubs into giving him jobs. Every club he's been at follows the exact same pattern. Some insane streaky wins followed by some of the worst results and total collapes you'll ever see, regardless of how much he gets backed (and he was, heavily, at Bristol City and Sunderland). Discount Alan Pardew but without any of his actual successes or even good single seasons.

Michael Appleton- This bloke has gotten an extraordinary amount of jobs in the EFL despite being rotten nearly everywhere and despite being very dislikable. Did a very good job at Oxford but only after being given a lengthy amount of time to get his own players in and benefitting from their great structure and academy. Ditto for Lincoln and he only had 1 good season there out of 3. Everywhere else, absolutely terrible, particularly Blackburn, Blackpool and Charlton.

Steven Gerrard- Bloody obvious looking at how unbelievably horrid he's been post-Rangers

Bruno Lage- His only good period of his whole sorry management career was a great 6 months at Wolves which quickly went to shit",12,1

We lack a dynamic forward on the ball outside of a 16 yr old in attack to really run at and harass defenders all game with the loss of Dembele and the failure to replace his profile in the squad. I made a comment in r/barca pointing out how important Dembele was to us last season when he played our record in the league was 16-4-2 with a GD of +37, when he was injured 9-2-2 with a GD of +9. Yamal and Dembele are similar in profiles but again the kid is only 16 and extrodinarily raw as player, yet is our best forward in nearly every game. 

Not bringing in DM to replace Busquets combined with the loss of ter Stegen to injury has led to our dominant defense of last year deteriorating. 

Due to the financial crisis at the club there is also little to no depth, causing us to depend heavily on the academy for depth, and then leading to the ones who are good enough to become mainstays getting injured from overplaying at such a young age. 

Due to the history of the club a lot of fans are spoilt and demand immediate success from any manager, and any poor result is seen as the end of the world. Many of the current fans myself included were drawn to the club during peak era of Barcelona 06-15, which has led to unrealistic expectations of not only players but managers as well.

It is their status, history and rivalry with Real Madrid that makes fans demands they do well though. Not just by being competetive, but also by playing beautiful and entertaining football.

I don't think much of Laporta but I think he hit the hail on the headâ€”it is extremely likely that at the first sign of convenience, the clubs he mentioned would instantly switch to the ESL given certain guarantees. In fact I'm sure most of these clubs that deny it already have plans in place.

Clubs like Ajax, PSV, Benfica, Sporting, Porto, Roma etc who have massive histories and are in countries that produce the best players in the world (many times coming directly from their academies), and yet none of them have had a sniff of continental success in decades bar some extremely lucky runs, instead being sidelined to middling leagues and needing to sell their best players to stay afloat.

if anyone really believes the dirextives of these clubs wont jump at the chance to increase their competitiveness and income, then i am very surprised.

It is so dependant on the players around you covering what they should cover and if they don't you could look like you aren't doing anything.

My Sunday league has 7 divisions. Division 7 is 40+ league, so the pace is pretty slow. 6-4 is incredibly amateur, guys who can't play a 5 yard pass. In those divisions your fitness really sets you apart as you can basically run the pitch past static defenders. Division 2-3 are pretty close together where most of the guys are young and fit so your fitness really only shows itself as an advantage in the final \~15 min or so.

The premier division is younger adults (18-21) who are still ""chasing the dream"" - trying to get onto university teams or semi-pro. Also can qualify for the Lamar Hunt Open Cup where you can actually play your way up to playing MLS Teams. I've found everyone to be really fit with not much to separate them.

Celtic should be aiming to buy a player who is capable of competing on a European stage, not a player who is just about good enough to get by in Scotland. 


Lawwell &amp; Desmond have shown time and time again they'd rather regress the club in order to keep the Old Firm alive and make money out the club that way, rather than try and move Celtic forward as a club. Shown that in the way they acted when Rangers were liquidated. Shown that in the pitiful levels of ambition and investment during the Lennon &amp; Deila years. Only reason they appointed Rodgers in 2016 was because they knew they wouldn't sell season tickets with the way they were running the club, and even then Rodgers left due to the lack of ambition (still dislike him for the way he left even if I will support him as manager of Celtic, but the reasoning why he left is pretty clear). Fuck I'd have to write a novel on the reasons why the board are hated but I think the fact that there's like 7 guys in very high board positions at Celtic from 3 families and two of our head recruitment guys are our CEO's son and former manager Gordon Strachan's son who's only other working experience is being his Dad's scout for two years and running a golf shop (his other son also has a coaching job here) should say a fucking lot about the way this club is ran. 



Celtic has so much potential and finance to be so much more than it is. Whether that be in the stands, or on the park on a European stage. The club is ran at amateurish levels which has seen it to the level we are at today on the park, and the fan relations with the board off it (even when we are winning trebles domestically, the fans still despise the board, for numerous reasons other than on the park issues).",2,1

Before player trading the revenue is pretty similar and Villa's high wages should somewhat go against them (even if it does make it easier for them to keep and attract big players.)

5497,"The narrative that clubs _pay_ referees is not very realistic (or maybe not so much since we have the Negreira case) but if we part from that premise, what's the cause for so many referee mistakes still happening even with VAR? Are referees just incompetent at their jobs by nature? And why does it seem that big teams are favored more, is it that referees respect them too much to make a call that's going to affect them? Or is it just a misconception based on the fact that more people watch big team's matches and therefore it seems that they get more calls?",3,0
5498,"1) I do think the crowd reaction sways referees so I guess it's a part of home team advantage.

2) We've seen VAR in the PL be scared to correct the ref because it undermines them. It's too adversarial, the culture should be they're a team who want the right decision being made, there shouldn't be any shame in making a mistake if VAR can catch it because we don't expect perfection, it's there to help catch the errors, it shouldn't be about anything else. 

3) There's too many situations where the refs say ""we're cracking down on x"" and they do for a couple matches, forget about it, then do it randomly through the season. I believe it's because for stuff like kicking the ball away or crowding the ref, a yellow is seen as too harsh (especially if they're on a yellow already) so we see a lot of ambiguity as various offences might be worth a fraction of a yellow, or a team might be getting out of hand so a ref gives a yellow as a warning to others, but it's too subjective. This then leads to fan speculation and a feeling of being hard done by.

4) I think football resisted technology for a long while, and there's still a cultural aspect which wants it to fail. I also think football has been too arrogant to learn from the implementation in other sports. I'm not saying it's without controversy, but now the Six Nations is back on I also see the TMO and wish VAR was more like that. I remember a controversy a long time ago about a ref asking the wrong question, something like ""can I award the try"" vs. ""is there any reason I cannot award the try"" as the type of confirmation asked for changes the answer, but overall it seems so much better. Likewise the ref only being spoken to by captain + a single player they choose to call over, instructions are given from the ref to the captain and they're told to tell their team. Broadcasting the communication again would help fans understand the process.

Having said all that, being a ref is a tough job, they're not paid enough, there's nowhere near enough put into helping new refs train and gain experience despite the huge amounts of money going around, but I don't think the organisations themselves do the referees many favours.",5,0
5499,"Typically big teams attack more, thus they have more opportunities for penalties and free kicks for them. Typically a way to even the odds against better opposition is more physical defending, which adds to the chance of calls against them

CFG buy Savio for Â£5m last year and he goes to Troyes. He's loaned out to 2 clubs, including Girona (CFG). Now City are interested. But since City will have to pay ""fair market value"" for him since they're a related club. Won't they potentially have to pay more for him than if they had just signed him for City in the first place (and loaned him out in the exact same way)?",2,0

If Girona have a world class talent playing for them, they can pretty much guarantee that they move to Man City, and Man City won't have to fight other clubs for their signature.",6,0

5886,There's no way it'll be fair money if you ask me.

But if you want to talk about 2006 and beyond, even Bruno Fernandes was better in the last one and that's one of many, Carvalho and Figo were better in 2006. Their attack was terrible in general for 2010 so I guess you could argue Ronaldo was the best attacker, but definitely not the best player overall. He had the same impact as players like Raul Meireles and Tiago. Carvalho had a decent tournament again, their GK Eduardo was the best player in their most difficult games vs Brazil and the 1-0 loss vs Spain.

2014 there was the injury and he was probably their best player in 2018, but still a 7/10 performance at best. Either way it's pretty shocking when compared to players like Maradona or Pele.

A performance like Forlan had in 2010, James Rodriguez in 2014 or Modric in 2018 was definitely within Ronaldo's reach imo. He had the ability but he just couldn't do it for one reason or another.

There's no other player in a top 10 all time list with a World Cup catalogue as poor as Cristiano. It's impressive that his other achievements managed to make him end up so high in these rankings, but it's also what stops me from putting him above Pele, Maradona or Messi, for what it's worth I wouldn't have put Messi among the other two either before 2022.",2,0

6142,"> Ronaldo getting 21 G/A in the PL is shit but Messi getting 20 G/A in Ligue 1 is alright.

Ronaldo was a target man, Messi was a 10 playing behind 2 strikers, and was the assist leader in 21/22

Also won the league comfortably when PSG failed to do so the previous season, Ronaldo did not contribute to winning and was often the scapegoat for not tracking back. At least that's the perception, as you can understand, i totally get the nuances of both cases (bad team all around for Ron, weak league for Leo)

Messi also did very well, (better than 21.22 at least) next season, some folk were talking him being top 3 for the Ballon Dor before the WC happened even, he started the season very well.

Ronaldo definitely hurt himself with this move, Messi would have been the same in that United side, because they both needed structure around them to be productive, at that age, especially in the physically demanding PL",-10,1

This is not the reason. Madrid is the only club that does _not_ need the money.

PÃ©rez, the kind soul that he is, wants other European clubs to get more money. Otherwise, Madrid will be the only relevant club that isn't English or funded by a state. Obviously he will take the biggest slice of the pot for Madrid.

If other European clubs stagnate, it will eventually be bad for Madrid as well because you run a risk of whatever the continental championship is becoming a 2nd class competition againsta the Premier Leagie.

But the underlaying point is true. Without the Super League, eventually (~15 years) the Premier League will overtake the UCL and obviously that's not good for Madrid. But with the BernabÃ©u hosting Duki, Taylor Swift, NBA and NFL, the club does not need money.

Of course there are the ego points, with previous Madrid presidents being co-founders of FIFA and the European Cup, he also wants something for his legacy.

And no doubt PÃ©rez himself will have more power when the clubs play in a competition he more or less controls. But he was the head of ECA before the Super League, only Ceferin and Infantino had more power.

I never agree with booing players who wear the shirt (except in exceptional circumstances) but there's a reason Fellaini was one of the few United players I remember being specifically booed by the Old Trafford crowd and it's because he was shit and (massively contributed to) fucking up our inability to play intricate football. He became a good plan B at points but it was a plan we were relying on way too often and that's good for short term results but long term if you want to get better at football you'll have to actually try sticking to the sorts of drills we're hopefully doing in training rather than panicking and throwing him on at 70 minutes for us to hoof it up to

Praise for his attitude is justified but as an actual footballer he was massively out of his depth. There's a reason we had no issue letting him go for Â£10m halfway through the season

We got what we deserved yesterday which was absolutely fuck all. I thought you guys were fantastic, pretty comfortably the best side I've seen us play this season.

Saw some of your fans worrying about relegation and while the points deduction isn't ideal I think you'll be fine. I was at the reverse fixture and thought you were a tidy outfit. There are a minimum 4 worse teams than you and your form isn't relegation form either.

6581,"We have individually good defenders, but s*ystematically* we are very poor. This little observation is more than born out by the stats.

We have an attack that can reliably tear up defences and score, but only score an average of 2 goals a game. That's not nearly enough to justify the amount of goals we leak.

Something needs to change, and it can't wait until next season. The way we are isn't sustainable even for a top 4 push in this league - forget title challenge. Rebuild or not, we need to be doing better.

On top of that, there's a terrible lack of discipline in this group. If it's not Romero, it's Bissouma. If it's not him, it's Udogie. If it's not Udogie, it's Kulu. I know Ange wants a self-regulating squad, but it's not working out too well. Sometimes there's no chance of the players changing unless the manager lays into them.

I think that's a fair and nuanced view of where we are at the moment. But this is viewed as being negative, and you get called toxic for pointing it out.",20,0
6582,"Its how you guys attack once settled on the ball. 3rd man runs from the fullback from deep into a central areas. People will say other teams use their fullbacks in midfield, but you guys send your fullbacks right down the middle of the pitch to create central access. 

So whats happening is when its executed it looks brilliant and when teams can knick the ball back or shut the angle off, you guys are being countered quickly and have one less defender back. 

Where most teams attack in like a 3-2 shape where the wide cb will overlap sometimes, and when he does its a safer pass, you guys start in a 2-3 and then the fullback makes that run creating a 2-2-6, with the pass too the fullback being risky. 

When it works, you guys are driving right down the heart of the team, when it doesnt, you are being countered quickly down the channels. Part of why ange wants extremely fast cbs is to cover those wide channels. High risk high reward system.",5,0
6583,You're in your first season going from playing defensive football to the complete opposite with a lot of the same players. Give it time,1,0
6584,"Contrary to your point, I would say our attack is not good currently 

When Ange came in, we all knew what the plan was. We are gonna ship 4 goals but we are gonna score 6 and it won't matter, now the first part is happening but the second one isn't. If we were ahead by 4 goals then even conceding that free kick goal doesn't matter. Ange has said that most improvement needs to happen in attacking part

Secondly, Mentality is not there, which covers our discipline issue. When we are 2 goals ahead and we concede one we kind of fall apart which leads to errors and unnecessary tackles, again I think we have more goals cushion then the discipline issue disappears",1,0
6585,You can only afford one very attacking fullback in the PL these days I feel unless you have two midfielders constantly covering for them like Liverpool did back then. If one of them plays as high as Udogie does then the other has to stay back most times imo,2,0

Udogie's lapsed defensively in the last couple of games, but on average he's been way better than he has any right to be at his age. Standout performances included comfortably pocketing Salah and our game against you guys where he was playing better against Saka *after* getting his yellow somehow.

Our defensive issues are structural mostly. On top of that, we don't defend with the same intensity we do in attack, randomly become lackadaisical, communication/awareness of teammates not good enough, and one or two more things.

We have the tools and material to improve there, but we can't ignore the problems any more.",1,0
6589,Udogie just fouls his winger a lot when he can't deal with them since his red card against Chelsea imo defensively he's got a lot worse and been a bit found out.

6590,"We had Bissouma cleaning up a lot of messes and doing a ton of good defensive work...when he was still in form. Has been off it since our Luton game and has been slow to get back into form.

Udogie I'm not too worried about. He's been inconsistent where his attacking and defending forms alternate in quality. I'm putting that up to youth and inexperience. Once he builds up experience and learns to cool his head, he's going to start playing to his full potential for us far more consistently.",0,0

Celtic fans keep telling me to be patient, and I'm going to *try* to not doom and gloom, but if we can't manage to shore up our defences a bit and regularly score 3-4 next season, then yeah, Ange is going to have to adapt.

I barely follow the United youth team at all but 'barely' accounts for about a quadrillion times more than the average football fan does and trust me Macheda had very little hype before he made his debut. He was just a decent youth prospect who managed to get a really nice debut goal but was never particularly hyped by those in the know 

Mainoo comes with the sort of hype from United youth team watchers that only a handful of other players have had, such as Pogba, Morrison and Greenwood, which is based on the qualities that they displayed at youth level. Macheda scored one nice goal on his debut at 17 and people pretend that he was someone United fans touted as the next best thing in football lol",2,0
6724,"I think midfielders have a better chance of following through with their hype. It's usually based on composure on the ball at a young age and good technical skills.

6726,"Mainoo was hyped for ages. Only United youth prospect since the Pogba generation to get more hype than Mainoo was Greenwood. Whose downfall had little to do with his footballing abilities. I suppose Januzaj was also was in the same ballpark, but again attitude issues.Â  Mainoo was as close to be a guaranteed success as you can predict with youth players. The only thing surprising is how comfortable he looks immediately since his first team introduction. Perceived lack of hype might also come from him being a midfielder as opposed to a forward like the two above, and not particularly a showboaty extroverted one like Pogba.Â ",1,0
6727,Mainoo has been incredibly hyped before he debuted lol,2,0
6728,mainoo has definitely been hyped up for awhile,2,0
6729,"'On the surface' doesn't really mean an awful lot. I think people should be trying to go a little bit deeper than just the surface before comparing every youth player we have to Macheda. Mainoo absolutely was rated as a much bigger prospect than Macheda by people who watch United youth matches. He might not be rated quite as highly as the other 3 but he's far closer to them in terms of hype than anyone else I can think of based solely on my perception

I think when a youth player starts breaking into the first team, it then becomes useful to listen to the hype they had as a youth team player to gauge whether they've displayed elite level talent at youth level and what their skillset is

Greenwood, Morrison and Pogba all came with the reputation of having elite technique. Mainoo doesn't quite have that reputation on their level, although his technique is very highly rated, but what massive hype he did get that stood out to me was people going on about his elite awareness/composure which is now clear to see from watching him play in the first team. The likes of Rashford and Macheda just never had that. Even Januzaj was rated higher than those two but nothing considerable",1,0
6730,Rashford was a bit like Macheda wasn't he? But actually following up on the unexpected early form,2,0
6731,"Rashford's neither. He was hyped at younger youth levels and had a lot more hype than was apparent by his debut. But had seemingly stalled a bit, and had a couple of others ahead of him in his position who people thought could make it.Â ",1,0
6732,"Yeah I wasn't particularly aware of who Rashford was when he made his debut. Someone like James Wilson had way more hype and looked amazing in the clips and few youth team games I watched 

That's why I can't take it seriously when people hype up players based on youth football alone. It's one thing playing well against boys but so much of the transition to the first team is just about how you'll adapt to playing against fully grown men, not about how good your football skills are against your peers. You can absolutely recognise talent in youth players but elite ability doesn't always translate into being an elite footballer at the highest level

It was just a month or two ago that I saw one of my fellow United supporters saying Isak Hansen-Aaroen should be included in the best young players in football and he's 19 without a first team appearance and now we've sold him to Werder Bremen

I can't say I've ever looked at Rashford and seen an elite ability he has. He's just a pretty well-rounded forward

That's why I'm now suddenly so excited about Mainoo though. He was rated as elite by youth team followers and now looks very capable in the PL too at 18",1,0
6733,"Rashford was considered a bigger talent than Wilson actually. Will Keane was the one with hype. Rashford just seemed like he had stalled by the time he made the u18s. Hence the lack of as much hype. Think Shola Shoretire now. He was hyped at a younger age, but seems to have not progressed as much as expected. Everyone has moved onto talking about the younger generation like Lacey and Ibragimov even. Rashford just got an unexpected chance when it seemed he had stalled at youth level because Will Keane and Fletcher were not available, and Wilson who had made his name the previous seasons in the junior team and considered ahead in the pecking order was also not available. He seemed like he came out of nowhere because he was behind a couple of others in the pecking order, and not necessarily because he wasn't considered a big talent.Â ",1,0

I sent all the parents messages on Thursday for the game. One did not confirm. One cancelled 3 hours before the game. So I had to pick two u9 who played this morning already (my son and some one else)

Then the kid that the parents didn't answer arrive 5 minutes later the meeting time. And complains he is on the bench and we have too many subs. I explained him that if I got answers (and it's not the first time from him, that would have been different).

I've an other who is already troublemaking at training. I had to pick him because he is just a kid and still deserve playtime. Oh god the way he acted. Asked to play defense, then refusing to play defense later, always walking, not challenging any ball, passing lazily from the outside of the boot, playing behind our own keeper (!)

It's sad because in the middle of that, I've some good kids and some who just want to be their own Mbappe and behave well, but there is really a lack of effort.

At this age, U10 and U10 are grouped together. We have a u11A team, a B team and a U10A and B. I got the B team. We often face teams mixing U10 and 11. It's just too hard for them. I think we literally had 10% of possession and one shot over 60 minutes.

I don't mind losing. I don't care about winning. I want the kids to have fun, progress and master the basics. But the way it's made, they are doomed to be at the bottom of the barrel and sink more. I just want 8 kids giving efforts. Those who ran the most were the U9 who played already 50 minutes 3 hours before.

When I told that to my friends they laughed in my face. Told me a big percentage of players would be fine with sitting most of the time and just cashing in.

You have Ter Stegen in goal, the sub isn't the best but Ter Stegen will be back for next season at the very least.

In defense, they have Araujo, Kounde, Christensen, and IÃ±igo Martinez, it's difficult to find a club with better options there. Fullbacks are solid in Cancelo and Balde, subs are not it but that's not the biggest issue in the world.

Their midfield consists of Pedri, Gundogan, Gavi, De Jong, Fermin, Romeu. Yeah, Romeu isn't starter quality so they do need a DM, but the rest is more than great. Few clubs have better options, I count 3, or 2 if they get a solid DM. 

In attack, they have Lewandowski, Felix, Ferran, Raphinha, Yamal, Roque. Lewandowski is obviously old, but I truly believe the current problems he's facing are more mental than physical. Even if they aren't, he's still better than what most big teams currently have including Liverpool, Arsenal, PSG, Madrid. Felix is talented, idk if he is doomed to be inconsistent or if he is just miscoached. Ferran and Raphinha might not be worth what they paid and they might not be the best players in the world, but they are still very good options to have. Then you have Yamal who is only going to get better if managed well and Roque who still hasn't found his footing.

Just to get an idea over the age of key players in the squad:

* Lewandowski (35)

* Gundogan (33)

* Ter Stegen (31)

* Cancelo (29)

* Christensen (27)

* Raphinha (27)

* De Jong (26)

* Kounde (25)

* Araujo (24)

* Felix (24)

* Ferran (23)

* Pedri (21)

* Balde (20)

* Gavi (19)

* Roque (18)

* Yamal (16)

Only Gundogan and Lewy are over the hill, and Gundogan has more than adequate alternatives.

Raphina and Ferran are nowhere near good enough (right now; they might improve) if you want to constantly fight for big trophies. They are just solid bench options. Lewandowski is also not as good as he was, and isn't a top 10 striker in the world right now. It definitely isn't certain that he would be the best option for Liverpool and Arsenal.

Not what I said. I said they need a maximum of 4 starters, but 2 would suffice. Only 1 is absolutely crucial, the rest would improve the team but their options there are good enough.

Yamal and  Roque are great prospects but probably too young to have a full impact. 

Then the rest are either over the hill or in my view just very standard. 

As a example, as United fan I would disappointed in signing any of Ferran, Felix, Raphinha, Christensen, Cancelo, Gudogan. I wouldn't mind Lewa but he is 35.

>The Red Devils have been trying unsuccessfully to sign new players such as Milan's Johann Vogel and Reggina's Carlos Paredes, and with just hours to go of the transfer window it appears that Ferdinand may be asked to fulfil the unfamiliar role once more against Blackburn on Wednesday.

>Wolves star Paul Ince also led the calls for the former Leeds man to play the holding role for England in the World Cup, and Ferdinand admits he would be happy to adapt for both club and country if needs be.

>""You have to be able to fit in all over the park if it benefits the team,"" Ferdinand told MUTV.

>""On Sunday, we had a lot of injuries and the manager also decided Darren Fletcher needed a rest, so I went in there.

>""It was an interesting, new experience but who knows whether I could step up to that position against an international side.

>""I am a centre half by trade and ideally I would prefer to play there.

>""But I will play anywhere for Manchester United or England and if the manager calls upon me to do that job again, I will.""

Rio was indeed asked to perform the midfield role again a few days later at Blackburn, but unfortunately it was a legendarily shit result for us as we lost 4-3 with David Bentley bagging a hattrick

The BBC match report said:

>Ferdinand had been impressive in midfield but a lack of communication saw him head Shefki Kuqi's flick towards goal as Van der Sar closed in to collect the ball.

Then he got sent off in the 88th minute for a second yellow, which was his only sending off in his 691 game career and accounts for two of his just 51 career yellow cards

A player like Palacios would be rated much much higher on here if he didnt play for Leverkusen.

Davies has been massively criticised by Bayern fans for a while. The fact he also mentioned FDJ, Kvara and Kimmich proves my point bc ppl have talked about Kvara's form and Kimmich not being he used to be (19/20 Kimmich was insane).

FDJ is the only example but it's also bc of Barcelona's tactics and lineups.

If it was the exact same song but in the 60s someone decided to make it our anthem nobody would care. 

You need to apply context here when they were signed we were going for top 4 and people said they weren't good enough for that, when we overachieved that they didn't get any credit and everyone just still says they're not good at all. Are they good enough to start every week if we want ti win the league? Probably not but realistically how many players are there that are if we want to beat city to the league? Arteta is just not desperate to get rid of them, Ramsdale is staying in Jan and they haven't tried to sell him, same for the others who start every week when they're fit.

Sorloth: 8.4, 2 assist, 1 goal amazing performance but he killed some of our attackâ€¦ still an amazing performance

Gerard: 8, dropped down to create, scored, amazing, typical Gerard performance playing well

Mandi: 6.5Terrible on the goal but got better. He also made a last ditch tackle in the match on roque or Yamal and that was perfect timing

Morales: 7.5: Came on and started the attack for our goal. And he scored the 5th goal. Definition of a late bloomer

Guedes; 8, Caused problems and Cancelo struggled against Guedes. Hope he is back and got the equalizer

Capoue: 8, great interception to give us the game winner. Was great offensively and important and in the back he was good

It's fair because these young members of the Indonesian diaspora are much better football players. 

This is the Asian Cup, not Sunday League. National teams pick the best available players to be as competitive as possible and give them the best chance to win, regardless of whether or not they played in qualifiers.

>why so many players are not born in Indonesia

They're European-born players who have part Indonesian ancestry (ie. part of the Indonesian diaspora). They are legally eligible for Indonesian citizenship because they have this Indonesian ancestry. The FA approached them and asked if they were interested in joining the Indonesian NT. Those that said yes  then went through the process of formally obtaining Indonesian citizenship, which allowed them to play for the NT.

I get playing with Walsh, Amat and to some degree Pattynama, they are all decent players with some pedigree and proven record...

Edit: I understand that ""importing"" players to play for your NT is the norm. A lot of nations around the world has being doing that with brazilians for decades, so I understand the reasoning.

>I do however have a problem with Justin Hubner being better at a MAJOR tournament than with exactly 0 matches at professional level

Okay but he has tons of experience playing in the european youth system, which is galaxies ahead of the senior leagues Indonesian players play in. He and Jenner are undoubtedly our two best, most consistent players in the tournament

These two things are not mutually exclusive. Ideally we'd want to be able to  both have a viable talent pool of players from local clubs, as well as be able to attract foreign born players. 

As for â€œthrowing in Dutch kidsâ€, well kids like Jenner, Hubner and Struick have already shown that they already have the quality to compete with almost any other midfield in Asia, with the exception of the top sides in the tournament. Are they the best in the cup? no, but we weren't expecting them to be best anyway.

That game was the culmination of his bad form, since then he has been steadily improving and idk if he'll ever get back to the levels before his knee injury but the last month he's been playing really well and that's closer to his usual level than the bad form.

The bottom line is as much criticism as he gets, Klopp clearly rates him over anyone else in that LW spot. Through bad form he still brings enough to the side that Klopp still wants him there, and now that he's back to his self seemingly absolutely no reason why that should change.

By the time Anderson had settled in, Fletcher was hitting his stride. He was definitely disliked by a lot of the fanbase from 03-07ish. Roy Keane even criticised him in that banned MUFC interview saying ""I can't understand why people in Scotland rave about Darren Fletcher"". It was a common sentiment to ridicule the guy, then a few years later he was in the PFA team of the season",1,1

It looked liked we self destructed yet again but luckily Barca decided to self destruct even hard and somehow bottled a comeback

Luckily for us Marcelino who I criticized for taking Gerard off and he proved me wrong by scoring 3 goals in winning 5-3.

*midweek preview*

Tomorrow and on Wednesday we have the FA Cup 5th round replays and some other matches to look at. The main talking point will be at Villa Park - after the controversy in the first match, how will Sammy Morgan fare against Arsenal? For Scunthorpe, there's a chance to shock the footballing world by beating Malcolm MacDonald's Newcastle.

Other non-First Division sides in contention are Carlisle (against Liverpool), Bolton (at Southampton), West Brom (at Everton) and Fulham (at Leicester). Lastly, there's an all-First Division tie between Derby and Coventry, while the Second Division tie between Orient and Portsmouth round up the FA Cup replays.

Two further matches in store this Wednesday - a place in the League Cup final is at stake, as Plymouth will try to make history and follow the steps of Swindon or Aston Villa in qualifying to the final. They will have a great challenge on Manchester City. Lastly, there's a Third Division match: Huddersfield Town v Blackburn Rovers at Leeds Road.

Another important fact is that most matches will be played at 7.30, with the generators ban overturned.

I don't hate you, Pep. I don't even dislike you. I do like you. I like you a hell of a lot more than I like most people in English football.  
  
I hate this idea that you're the best. Because you're not. I'm the best. I'm the best in the world. There's one thing you're better at than I am and that's kissing Seikh Mansour's ass.

I've been the best ever since day one when I walked into this company. And I've been vilified and hated since that day, because Michael Edwards saw something in me that nobody else wanted to admit. That's right, I'm a Michael Edwards guy. You know who else was a Michael Edwards guy? Brendan Rodgers. And he split just like I'm splitting. But the biggest difference between me and Brendan is I'm going to leave with the Premier League Title.

Whoops! I'm breaking the fourth wall!  
  
I am the best manager in the world.  
  
And yet no matter how many times I prove it, I'm not on your lovely little Masterclass videos. I'm not on the cover of the Premier League program. I'm barely promoted. I don't get to be in Tifo videos. I'm certainly not on any crappy show on Sky Sports. I'm not on the signature that's produced at the start of the season. I'm not on Monday Night Football. I'm not on Match Of The day. But the fact of the matter is, I should be.

Because you're the ones who are watching those Masterclass videos. You're the ones that buy those programs that my face isn't on the cover of. And then at five in the morning at the training ground, you try to shove it in my face so you can get an autograph and try to sell it on eBay because you're too lazy to go get a real job.

By all accounts, Roque isn't gonna be ready to be a starter for a top club within the next 6 months. And I'm not basing that off of his first month in Barcelona but rather on the fact that he's a teenager coming from Brazil. Even Vini took 2 years to break through as a world class player.

>a new DM, as OP said

Easier said than done when you have De Jong on 750k a week occupying a spot.

> Raphinha and Yamal are prefectly fine

Raphinha might get the G/A but watching him play he really doesn't seem to be the type of Barca calibre winger. Yamal is sadly gonna be run into the ground at this rate.

> Cancelo in summer

Which is gonna cost money they need for the DM and LW.

> He's not injured long term, it's only this season

He's been a shadow of himself this season and is now out for some 4 months which isn't gonna help him.

Saying ""they don't need a rebuild, just a LW and DM"" is underselling it quite a bit. Barca's best bet would be to sell Araujo and De Jong for 160m and use that to rebuild the squad instead of selling Barca Studios for nth time.",1,0

Don't get me wrong, I still think international tournaments are the pinnacle of football and understand that qualifiers are a long arduous campaign. I just wish the final process of crowning a winner was a bit more drawn out over a longer period of time like the UCL and less subject to one bad match ending a run early.

The fact that so many years of anticipation and months, even years of preparations can just go down the drain at any point during the knockout rounds in a single 90 minutes match adds such a unique layer of pressure you simply don't get anywhere else, which I think is one of the best things about the WC.

It would be a midfield of Isco, Kroos, Modric and Casemiro with Benzema and Cristiano upfront.

If you're interested, rewatching Madrid's UCL goals that season is pretty fascinating. They scored the bulk of their goals from early crosses (usually Marcelo, Carvajal or Kroos). Juventus were obviously prepared for this in the final, but Madrid changed their approach completely and scored 3 of the 4 goals by feinting a cross and instead playing a cut back or overlap to the byline.

They worked with expected revenue and then got grouped in the UCL which only cut into their revenue stream.

Laporta knew their financials were fucked but evidently played a gamble that wasn't worth it. Looking through their transfer activity, Barcelona may need to do what they should have done two seasons ago and that is build on their youth with some experience and wait for them to develop. Though a part of me isn't convinced by this higher youth academy output, that has never changed, only their playing time has.

By now there should be routines and a tactic that everyone is familiar with to fall back on to kill a game and grind out a win.

They have less time to set themselves, less time to read direction, less time to react etc. So many forwards seem intent on getting into the best position possible before taking on a shot, but I'm telling you right now, even if it feels counterintuitive, you're giving the keeper a much better chance of saving it the longer you take.",2,0

With SAF, he had a legendary and intimidating presence about him. With Mourinho, he has the charisma but obviously fell out with too many players and clubs with his antics. With Wenger, it felt like he was a shell of his former self after Arsenal moved to the Emirates. Pep, as much as he is a genius, has less personality than me front door.

Klopp is different. There's just something about him which commands respect from anyone who plays under him, and it dates all the way back to when he started his managerial career at Mainz. He definitely is charismatic, but it's not the same kind of charisma as what Mourinho displays. He has amazing rapport with his players, no player has ever talked shit about Klopp. Klopp has that father figure presence about him, probably stemming from the fact that he is a giant if you've ever met him in real life. 

He will be a bigger loss to Liverpool than Gerrard was, because Gerrard was already on his last legs when he left.

HereÂ´s what i thought of it because while i gathered at first itÂ´d be to help Napoli on the defense (dude is a defensive midfielder positions-wise), then i saw his stats of how he wins a lot of aerial duels (like, near 90%) and well, me went ""what if like, Napoli from time to time use him as a winger or like a second striker?"" because with how good he must be at aerial duels, surely he could be sent a bit forwards from time to time if required to score goals right?

Serie A has seen its fair share of brilliant players in the last couple of years, but Lautaro's current season is the most impressive and impactful in recent times. His statistics speak to his general brilliance, unfortunately, they do not encapsulate the full picture. Everyone around Lautaro performs better when he is playing, due to his brilliant football IQ. His way of creating space and being the perfect playing station elevates his surroundings to an astounding level. Lautaro's movement inside the box is a level above that of other players in the world. Inter, without Lautaro, is a completely different team, for the worse. 

Inter is one of the competitors for the Champions League, and I do not think many here would be surprised if Inter reaches the final again. Serie A watchers know that Lautaro is essential for Inter's continuous improvement each year. In tandem with Lautaro turning into a more improved version of Tevez, Inter has become a better team. 

Lautaro Martinez is a top 5 player in the world and should have been more prevalent in the discussion for the Ballon d'Or. The unfortunate reality is that most people still massively underrate Lautaro due to the World Cup and his playing style, which isn't flashy, but instead hard-working, effective, and tactical.

After annihilating Porto, City and Roma on their way to Kyiv with the fabled front three of Salah, Mane, and Firimino, the final itself was rather anti-climatic. After Salah was taken off with a shoulder injury, everything went tits up afterwards. Karius will be fondly remembered for his earth shattering mistakes that handed Real Madrid their 11th title.

Most teams who experienced that level of heartbreak and bad luck would fade away but not Klopp. His Liverpool team were undeterred and went one better by winning their sixth CL crown the following the year. Their Premier League campaign was quite remarkable as the greatest team to not be champions. 97 points would win the league in every season but they had unfortunate luck finishing behind City who become champions with one point better. Liverpool were victims of circumstance because had it not been for John Stone's inch perfect clearance off the line, Liverpool would have been champions that year. 

Did that deter them? Not the slightest. In fact, Liverpool absolutely destroyed the entire league by winning all but one game by Xmas. An earth defying 27 wins out of the 28 matches. The win streak did slow down in the lockdown after Covid shut the whole world down but it was more than enough to break their 30 year drought.

99 points. The second highest points tally in Premier League history. I don't think people had grasped the mental toll and stress it took on Klopp and even though Liverpool won multiple trophies and reach the Champions League final in 2022, they weren't quite the same side that dominated the world. They played with less intensity and that reflects on Klopp who probably had drained all his energy into Liverpool and today he decide he can't give anymore left.

In that time period between 2018-2022, Liverpool  were probably the top 3 best team in the world. From where Klopp found them back in 2015, it was one of the greatest rebuild in football history.

Second leg we go ahead twice but we were clearly depraved of all energy, so we again conceded two goals in the end of the game. If anything Roma was lucky with Milner scoring an own goal by his face (one of the luckiest goals ever literally) and got gifted a penalty towards the end.

I think squad depth, in general, was a bigger issue in regards to maintaining consistency and winning more trophies than specifically having a better first choice midfield. The infinite City money was never about biggest spending on individual players, but being able to do things like spending 200M on fullbacks/defenders in one window to see what sticks. 

They were a 30yd screamer from Vincent Kompany late in 2019 season from winning the PL in 18/19. I'm not sure a better midfield makes them better than 97 points.

20/21 almost all of their issues can be placed on injuries.

Football fans love an effort merchant though and he was surely that

He was competent at centre back and left back but in January 2006 we completed the signings of Vidic and Evra who were both much better players in those positions so Heinze found himself benched and wanting an exit

United said no problem we'll let you leave for Â£6.8m (probably equivalent to about Â£20-25m nowadays) and his agent started briefing clubs

Benitez at Liverpool really fancied him and matched the asking price, but not wanting to sell him to a rival Fergie told Liverpool to fuck off and told Heinze he'll never sell him to Liverpool. Heinze lawyered up and took his case directly to the PL but they said he has no case, during which Simon Jordan, chairman of Crystal Palace at the time, testified that he was approached by agents who offered him the chance to buy Heinze and then immediately sell him to Liverpool for a Â£1m profit

Future of football imho:

- Decrease pitch sizes 20%

Players are more technical today. They don't need the same amount of space. Due to the size of football pitches, football is more about running than about control.

- Play 25x2 min effective time

The other ideas I have would increase the intensity of the game and for obvious reasons no more than 50 minutes (this a little less than the average today) of effective football can be played.

- Unlimited, free subs (no need to wave around signs and all that shit)

Would increase intensity, quality and decrease injuries. This is how people played as kids so why the fuck can't they do it in pro football.

- Free kick takers can take free kicks to themselves (same with corners and kick-ins)

The fact that you can't ""pass yourself"" on a freekick is a moronic rule. WHY is it like that? This has been trialed and is a likely future change of the game regardless if you want it or not.

We can't and won't be able to compete with nearly every PL clubs when it comes to buying the best players. So we have to do things in a different way, usually meaning we're signing potential and turning it great.

Graham Potter did not get a set of ready-made Champions League midfielder. Bissouma was a moderately promising AMC signed from Lille and was a substitute in attacking roles when CH coached us. When Graham came and put him as DMC, he rapidly turned into our best player.

Alexis Mac Allister was signed as a young and technical winger (capable of playing as ten) from Argentina. There wasn't anything ""Champions League"" level about him at that point. We reschooled him as a DMC and in due time he turned into one of our best players.

Moises Caicedo also wasn't Mr Champions League when he arrived. Bloke came from the feckin' Ecuadorian league and struggled in the Belgian league when on loan there. But we worked with him, and thats how we got our CL midfielder.

""RDZ should feel hard done by losing his midfield without replacements"", some say. I say he'll have to do like Potter and others and build those players himself. Which I btw think he is doing a good job at.

Other clubs hire coaches as some sort of millionaire-shephard but for us you actually need to do what you're paid for: improve players.

on the flipside it's the top divisions that create interest in the game as a whole as well as set a ridiculous bunch of standards, create innovations and so on that the lower leagues benefit from, not to mention create revenue for the game as a whole, some of which does find its way through to lower league teams directly and indirectly


this isn't to say one division is more important than the other, they are all important but imo best not try to get into a battle of who needs who more because it'll just get nasty whilst not going anywhere.


>The massive discrepancy between the PL and EFL along with parachute payments encourages and at this point even necessitates that teams with PL ambitions spend recklessly.


a club spending recklessly to get into the pl is their own business, unless you enjoy clubs being told by the pl or some other body how much they are allowed to take risks. you may like that idea, but then that means you have to accept that you're just making it easier for the top clubs to stay at the top, as they don't have to take as much risks to stay there if lower clubs can't invest to compete.


this eventually leads to no relegation or promotion by stealth, where the teams getting promoted and relegated get even more samey because it's much harder to challenge the pecking order


it's almost as if you're implying that the pl should stop earning so much so that the lower leagues are under less pressure which is obviously absurd. 



>The absurdity of revenue in the PL already drives inflation in the championship.

I think it's more likely that this well lead to the prem falling behind continental rivals which will then inturn hurt revenues and just be bad for little in return


even if I'm wrong on that what do you think the efl should give in return? if the pl is going to share out more of the revenue its generated with the risk of falling behind rivals, it will likely want something in return from the efl, what do you think that'd be? or do you think the pl should just give the efl money for nothing?",0,0

Henry > R9 and zidane based on what they actually did and not â€œnatural ability.â€

On that note players who do things that look nice often are overrated they aren't actually effecting the hand that much but they look like they do a lot more than they do because they have a nice first touch or a nice close control. Kovacic is a perfect example of this never been great at all but because he can dribble past 2 people and then pass back to the centre back he's somehow scammed a way to Man City. 

Heung Min Son was better than Kane for spurs during the time period of 19/20 to 21/22 and he is unfairly labelled a purple patch merchant he should have shed that a while ago. 

Bruno and rashford can't be consistent starting players in a title winning side at least together maybe rashford can with a team around him. 

The premier league in terms of entertainment not quality is the worst it's ever been, it's too predictable now and for me personally the best part of sports is the fact you're not meant to know what's going to happen. 

On that note as well a playoff system for the league title would be way way better because of that it's boring when a season is basically done with weeks or months to go this would give a lot more teams something to play for, too will never happen though.

there's then the fact that rooney was a pl starter since 16, unlike kane.

12208,">Kane incredible from open play as well. And a much, much better goalscorer than Rooney

never said kane wasn't good in open play, it's a given. rooney proved he could score lots of goals, but he mostly played behind a striker and supported them so of course he scored less than kane who's often played as a lone forward.


had rooney been playing now, he'd maybe be an amazing lone forward unless he ended up playing outwide or as an attacking midfield. if you put kane in rooney's era, he'd probably be scoring less due to playing behind someone like rooney did and probably end up being seen as england's answer to bergkamp or something

All of the teams are named after the company that owns them (leading to situations where the team with the third most league wins can just go out of existence once the parent company thinks the basketball operations have ceased to be profitable) and are mostly based around the capital.

I don't care for pendalum swings I have eyes, Jones has been better this season, if sobozolai imporves and becomes better he can take back his spot, Jones has been our best midifleder and our general most consistent player behind VVd and Allison(who are the most consistent performers) since he started starting in the run in last season, which for a midifleder ina title challenging team is the most important quality.

Tell me why we should put sbozlai ,who has been great of ball all season(which Jones is great at) but above average on the ball for 2/3rds of the current season while Jones has been great on that too, over Jones.

That it is disregarding if Thiago is coming back to 21/22 levels or 22/23 levels, we are unlikely to start him we are more likely to use him as a super sub given his fitness issues.

So the midifled would be maca, Jones sobozlai which was our midifled against city away despite Jones recently combing back from injury that game and we still pretty much went blow for blow(their goal came of an Allison mistake), which Thiago /Elliot/endo/grav/bajeticit coming on if needed or someone is underperforming.",2,0

Germany doesnt have better midfielders than him in that position though. Its mostly slow playmakers who cant defend (Kroos GÃ¼ndogan etc) or attacking midfielders, Goretzka is usually our only real B2B midfielder

There's lots of City hate on here, but there's plenty of Messi fanboys who love Pep, Barca fans, and online tactics guys who love Pep to counteract and override that hate in most situations.

Liverpool doesn't have the backing of the Messi fanboys/Barca fans, especially after Anfield 4-0 kept their idol without a CL since 2015. Liverpool also has the primary rivalry hatred of several of the other biggest fanbases on this sub. 

Now to Mourinho... All three of those major factions (Messi fans, Pep fans, English fans) tend to hate Mourinho. Based on the r/soccer census age demographics, and his most successful stint in England being in the mid 2000's at r/soccer hated Club Chelsea, means most people on this subreddit weren't even watching football back them, some of them probably weren't even born based on some of the opinions you see upvoted here.

He also did it without a super team and the endless resources like Jose had at Chelsea, he developed these players into what they were, and guys like BÅ‚aszczykowski, GroÃŸkreutz, Schmelzer, SubotiÄ‡, and Lucas Barrios played big roles. No disrespect to them they were all good but he really got the most out of them they were not more than just good players imo. He also won the DKB Pokal and got them to a CL final,his job in establishing them firmly as the second team in Germany there was outstanding as well as competing with Bayern and beating them to titles. 

He then goes to Liverpool who were a complete joke at this point, and wins everything with them going against Pep who is the GOAT who has far more resources than him again, make 3 CL finals winning 1 of them,wins the league on a team that would have smashed the points record if fans stayed and they were motivated, gets 90 plus points a few times and also wins everything available to him, with an underdog team again. 

Jose is the biggest fake underdog ever in his CL win with Porto which everyone hyped up they were the favourites in the final against Monaco, and they beat Lyon, Deportivo and Manchester United who were the third best team in England and only beat them because of a bad decision.

Real Madrid was only the third best team in Spain that season (like United in Porto's winning season) and Dortmund only beat Malaga in the quarters due to a last minute offside goal. You see how it works both ways? Liverpool also had a very easy run in 21/22 beating a pretty weak Inter, Benfica and Villarreal to make the final (which they lost)

Thats just absolute horseshit lmao, neither Inter or Villarreal were weak by any means. Inter finished second in Serie A and won the coppa italia, and Villarreal knocked out both Juventus and Bayern. 

The whole paragraph about City taking 5 years to win the league is just a weak argument, Mourinho still benefited a lot from the pool of players he had in the mid 2000s regardless of what happened in City's case. They spent an unprecedented amount of money even before they signed Mourinho.

What city did just isn't comparable if you adjust it for inflation the spending was insane any decent manager on earth wins a league with Chelsea at that point. City also started from a much lower point, he took over a Chelsea side that was already second and added that ridiculous spend on it of course they were going to win the league.

So a team that dominates weaker opponents in qualifying rounds and owns the Group Stages at tournaments is going to have really high ratings.

Just like in South America kids growing up with a ball (even made of rugs and rubber) at their (bare) feet will develop skills that can be developed later on. I would argue, the problem with African countries is that there is probably a lot more talent that gets wasted because skilled kids can't afford to travel, train, access organised football teams and leagues. Usually their only luck is travelling abroad or getting trafficked to Europe by shady scouts. The football culture is big in Africa as well as in other poor south American countries, so kids and adults watch football on TV, watch live football games and are way more active than Indian and Chinese people in consuming football and playing football. It's not only about skills, but also about dreaming to become a footballer, having interest and a real passion for the sport which can only come if the community around you shares the same passion. On average Indian and Chinese kids care much much less than Nigerian or Congolese kids about playing and becoming football players. It's also that African kids can idolise football stars from their own country and try to become like them. For Asian kids it might be more difficult, unless they're Korean or Japanese because they can aspire to become like Son or Mitoma.

I disagree on this somewhat. Sacrificing control in some areas will hurt you in others. Arsenal is this season is the perfect example of this. Your defensively solidity has hampered your attack. There's a video of Rice and other midfielders refusing to play line breaking passes from their half because it's a lower percentage pass that could result in a counter the other way. 

What's my point? My point is that every system sacrifices something to gain something else. Ange is uncompromising in his tactics, time will tell if it's right for the PL.

All the underlying numbers said that wasn't going to last even when they stayed fit and I believe that.

I don't get why so many Arsenal fans seem to continue to believe this narrative that you struggle against teams that sit back and batter teams that play openly when it's just not true.

He was saying teams just sit back against you lot and you struggle to score. That's not really true. You've battered plenty of teams that do that, and also struggled a lot against other teams that play openly.

It's pretty obvious to me that it's a performance problem, not a specific problem against certain tactical systems.

Last year, you were comfortably dominating teams that sat back with pretty much the same players.",2,0
13560,"No we haven't we battered Sheffield United who aren't a premier league team and that's it, Bournemouth didn't try and sit back and that's the only other game we won by 3 or more in the league. In terms of teams that play openly I'd say the performances have been better but we haven't taken the chances except Liverpool. 

They weren't sitting back as much in games and we also didn't have the same players Jesus and zinchenko have had injury issues, partey has barely played, white has been injured and xhaka isn't there at all. 

I think there are multiple issues and tactically the worst one is playing Eddie Nketiah this meltdown would be nowhere near as bad if he didn't play Eddie against Fulham I 100% believe we win that if he doesn't do that. 

We also have a bunch of players that are really reliant on other players, Havertz can only play midfield when we have one or both of Jesus or zinchenko, martinelli can only play well if Jesus is upfront, we can't build up at all without zinchenko unless we play Jorginho.

It's just greed. 

Ofc, not everyone sees life the same way and that's also fine. But when people say â€œyou'd do the sameâ€, fuck no I wouldn't go sell out in Saudi Arabia for some extra money if I was already a wealthy footballer. If you would, that says more about you as a person. And in the case of someone like Henderson, he was fully aware of the awful things the Saudi regime does.

But even then, you have to be extremely out of touch not to see it's a shameful thing to do. That's why many players, like Henderson, create some bs PR piece about the â€œprojectâ€ or whatever. And I know that in this society we've built money is king and so many people become slaves to it. But purely from a human standpoint I can't imagine wanting even more money in a world where people are suffering and can't even afford to eat or drink.

That's before we consider that he basically exposed himself as doing these things just for PR, as he had no qualms moving to Saudi Arabia which relentlessly persecutes the people he pretended to care about. Especially considering he has made immense amounts of money, and as captain of one of the biggest clubs in the world would never struggle for a job or money post retirement.

But I totally agree with what you said, their stance on so many things is historic. I wish the whole world was more progressive in allowing people to do whatever they want as long as it isn't causing harm to others.

Honestly I have to give it more thought but that's just my instant reaction. 

Also, I would say comparing the Saudi league to Russia and China is slightly off the mark. The Russian league has a long and storied past. The Chinese league also didn't attract names at the level of the Saudi one (Altho that's crumbling, they still have Ronaldo).

But actually packing bags and *moving* to the country with the awful human rights violations? To a league that is fundamentally piss compared to any European league? There's no hiding why they did that. It's for the money and it's flagrantly endorsing the views of the league's sportwashing.",3,1

Using a made up example: let's say you have Company A which is known for having terrible working conditions.

[Chris Basham Vs Leeds](https://youtu.be/68fiSsu0POw?si=IqncaK7ff2yH_kCQ): I don't care about the maths this is when we got promoted, against Leeds of all teams. I think this goal is probably what fully cemented Bash as a club legend.

[Mark Duffy Vs Wednesday](https://youtu.be/RmQWL-FzOL4?si=Vrml_iYV3hZLLKWu): Can't tell you how many times I've rewatched this, absolutely incredible. Mark Duffy was such an incredible player it's a shame he never got a crack at the prem.

[Tommy Doyle Vs Blackburn](https://youtu.be/TwfPHksmNuQ?si=4wA11NQd-DnzwycJ): Only goal on this list I was in the stands for, sensations strike that meant I got to go to Wembley for the first time. I miss you Tommy come back.


[John Fleck Vs Wednesday](https://youtu.be/o_JNksWSd1Q?si=4RGcQTwQHYARFKiS): This was the goal that showed we were above Wednesday, they'd been a division above us for years. Constant jokes from my Wednesday side of the family, this goal was the paradigm shift and what a goal it was


[Sharp Vs Bournemouth](https://youtu.be/H3tLpNWSWRA?si=9nAcMSd04q6z-ZQp): Culmination of our journey from League One back to the Prem. It just had to be him

[Crouch v Man City](https://youtu.be/yO9Kcjlwmic?si=y44XpR-pqzNiB71h): The goal that got Spurs in the CL for the first time. We are not where we are now without it. After those near misses under Big Martin Jol this felt special 

[Lucas v Ajax (3rd goal)](https://youtu.be/xykJYYgohSE?si=wlokUR3CtL6WnXlW): Even knowing how the final went, I still can't watch this without getting chills. Darren Fletcher's best work as a commentator, instantly iconic

[Kane v Arsenal](https://youtu.be/xPpbhu0CwH4?si=HZEmF4mvcHzW-FEz): The ridiculous angle. The facemask coming off, those 14 minutes of ecstasy at being on our way to the top in March until Sanchez cruelly snatched them away

[Kelly v Germany](https://youtu.be/wax6vu5B0pQ?si=lBqwZP2lT6Q7bnY-): _Everyone seems to know the score, they've seen it all before...._ the day the Euros came home. It had to be in my list, it just had to

[Collin v Stevenage (2nd goal)](https://youtu.be/6U3i9X0QBRE?si=FO8AAXV_MnQsNYYI): The 14/15 FA Cup was the first time Maidstone had made the 1st Round Proper since reformation. Getting a late (definitely offside) winner to make it to Round 2, and a BBC Wales game against Wrexham sparked euphoria in the town

[Corne v Stevenage (Penalty)](https://youtu.be/lW6GypZgVhU?si=qqlj2TzAmO7NtxFT): If I had a nickel for everytime Maidstone celebrated a post-reformation first by getting Stevenage, beating them at home thanks to a goal directly in front of where I was standing, with a post-match pitch invasion and a TV draw the next round, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's flipping amazing it's happened twice

And not officially a goal, but as a seventh I've got to mention -

[Dier v Colombia (Penalty Shootout)](https://youtu.be/RbmaLT320hw?si=cKHBV7PSX3INwu5I): England and Penalties. They just don't mix. I understand people who prefer Trippier's free kick or Shaw against Italy, but winning a shootout? After being behind in the shootout? That just doesn't happen",1,0

The shooter kicked it with the outside of the foot and curled from the outside of the wall into the near corner (top right).

* [Van Nistelrooy vs Valencia](https://youtu.be/TJfmQywpYzc): best team goal I've ever seen. Quick passing, great movement and understanding, great cross, and amazing volley to finish it off.

* [Zidane vs Italy](https://youtu.be/eAp86cTUOYM): every single person on earth knows this goal. The audacity is what puts it so high, and why it's ahead of his [volley vs Leverkusen](https://youtu.be/rFfomw-Z4uE?si=JBDga_1bBz-W6t-_).

[Harry Kane vs Arsenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKuWEvHN6u4): A Kane goal was always going to appear here, and this one in the derby might be the best one he ever got for us. Kane is a player that we will be telling our grandkids about.

[Son vs Man City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exwCSLlZLfM&amp;t=47s): Son is the soul of our team, and this goal against Man City shows why we love him. Great finish in a big game (even though our manager in this game was Nuno).

[Eriksen vs Chelsea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgUpGa4P2R4): I always loved Eriksen, so seeing his near-death experience was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. He always loved scoring worldies for us, and this one, in our only win at Stamford Bridge in my lifetime iirc, is probably his best.

[Bale vs Liverpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfhFW18uhBE): Not a Spurs goal, but I doubt I will ever see a goal this good in a final ever again. Also, Bale might have the best individual performances for Spurs of any player.

[Dele vs Man United](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mf7XY4NyT0E): Dele's most remembered goal for us is probably the one vs Palace, but this one is just as good. This flick couldn't have been executed any better, and this is Dele at his best.",6,1

I'm not saying the careers of the players I've mentioned would've been the same had they attended another football academy, it definitely wouldn't have been because they would've started at different clubs, had different levels of exposure to scouts and the likes, and had different lives.

I think some people would be good no matter what but not everyone, what if you have people in your own team pushing you to do better? Some people are so good at a young age that they aren't motivated to keep getting better and it catches up to them.

* Small and midsize cities slowly became unable to sustain big, successful football clubs as money's influence on football became more and more important.
* As big European metropolitan centers, such as Paris and London, continue to grow in importance and influence and as football becomes a freer market, football clubs from there will become more successful by benefiting from their strategic location.

Spain's Real Madrid became a giant club during Franco's rule and London and Rome clubs have had generally less success historically than clubs from other parts of the country. London clubs, especially Chelsea, benefit from it being ever-growing as a global financial and influence hub.

Berlin was also a totalitarian state's capital, and then Dynamo Berlin dominated East German football. You can also see how being a major population hub has helped them recently: Union Berlin has thrived and, while a failed project in sporting terms, Hertha Berlin got huge investments in recent years.",10,0

Same for people like Saka, I feel like I've never heard someone describing him as a player. As a winger, what are his strenghts? What makes him crucial to Arteta's aystem? Where does he need to improve?

Even Haaland, he's always called a poacher. I don't even neccessarily disagree with that opinion, but why does no one ever elaborate it? Why is he a poacher? Is his first touch inaccurate? Does he struggle at beating his man? Does he not link-up well with his teammates?

MbappÃ© has the best decision-making of any winger in world football for me, he's so intelligent in knowing when to recycle the ball, when to progress it, when to attempt a dribble and when to shoot.

Pedraza: 1, Crosses all over the place and defensively not much better

Bailly: 2, Not much better and didn't help Cuenca but wasent that bad but didn't help either. You concede 3 goals you have to subtract from that

Cuenca: 4, He was actually good. He was trying and did the correct things. Unfortunately you conceded 3 so that means I can't give him higher then a 4

Altimira: 1, he's young he will get better but unfortunately he was painfully bad today. 

Baena: 1, Didn't know he played tbh he was terrible

Parejo: 0, Invisible, he had 3 passes at one point in the game while there midfielder had 20. That should say it all really he never got the ball never did anything.

Santi: 0, Terrible again thought he would of done better but his header for the second goal he looked weak. Bad game again

Illas: 4, he ran he tried to do something but he had no support. It sucks cause he was alright but we're relying on this kid to be our creative player.

Morales: 2, Sometimes you get amazing performances from him. Other times you get this.

Gerard: 7, He was amazing for us again. Gerard was literally doing Parejo's job, Baena's job and Morales job. He got unlucky and created well. I feel for him he has saved us many times but he can't do it often anymore.

Sorloth: 3, better then Morales but not by much. He mistimed his runs and was off on his heading game

However it turned out Chelsea also wanted him and after a long legal battle and them paying off Lyn and United, he signed for them instead
 
Aaron Ramsey. We announced that we agreed a deal with Cardiff for him on our website. Unfortunately Wenger persuaded him more than United could and he signed for Arsenal instead 

Adem Ljajic. We announced a deal for him and his Partizan Belgrade teammate Zoran Tosic, but while Tosic was able to get a work permit, Ljajic wasn't and he ended up signing for Fiorentina instead

 People do not realise how difficult it was (and is) for a team like Spurs to attract and retain great players. When Enic took over Spurs was a side languishing for years just below the upper level in England. Our last great signings were Ardiles and Villa - Klinsmann was a fluke. When a team does not have recent glory or a charismatic manager, attracting great players is hard. Chelsea and Man City solved that problem by spending large sums of money. Levy ruled that out by the decision to build up the team's finances organically by reinvestment. As a Spurs supporter from the days when Spurs were docked points for financial shenanigans, I wholeheartedly support this strategy.   
Even when Alan Sugar took over and provided some financial stability, his footballing inexperience hurt Spurs (Anyone remember ""Carlos  Kickaball""?). Enic to me was a breath of relief.

If it was that clear, his agent would have already communicated that to us. We all know how these transfers work, there has 100% already been at least a phone call or two.

When AndrÃ© Onana refused to play the first game at the AFCON, I said nothing because I always thought he doesn't give a shit about the team since the 2022 World Cup drama and the second worst retirement announcement in football history since Messi in 2016.

  
But I reached my boiling point when i wasn't able to see the only friendly game Cameroon will play before the AFCON today against Zambia. The game was at 2 pm and when the whistle went in Jeddah, the national sport channel was rebroadcasting a Women Volleyball World Cup 2022 match between Cameroon and Puerto Rico. This is hugely concerning. Firstly because we lost that volleyball game 3-0 (I mean, at least rebroadcast a shit we won), and secondly because the game was decided at the last minute to not be broadcast by Cameroon and Zambia federations because [they wanted to keep their tactics secret before the AFCON ](https://x.com/marcchouamo/status/1744823373807399294?s=20)! This is a thing I have never heard of before. A national team depriving the nation from seeing the team play just to keep the ""the element of surprise"" like if it was a John Oliver happening. I don't know if I can correctly transcipt in this message in english how stupid i think this decision is.



They'll flood us with targeted ads begging to buy the special national shirt for this AFCON, and when we just need to see the team touch the ball, the Federation goes ""Don't worry, just trust the process, we are cooking."" The fact is not only hiding the process is the worst way to make people believe in it, but the most infuriating, Cameroon drew 1-1 that game against Zambia ! They haven't even won it to make us believe it was a kind of 4D-chess move from President Eto'o. We drew and with our social medias representive being legendary bad, there is no live comment of it on Twitter or anywhere else. The fact is even journalists have to fully rely on the National Squad Press Team to know if there were substitutions because that was not noticed by anybody present during the game. The reality is, we don't even have a real proof that the game actually took place. They could be at Jeddah just dancing the Roger Milla celebration for 90 minutes and call it a day, and there is nothing to prove it wrong. There is no photo, no video, no press conference, even the name of the referee is a mystery.

  
I will always say in total seriousness that Samuel Eto'o highly improve the managment of football in this country despite having many rivals praying for his failures, people go to see local clubs, there is Cameroonian Ballon d'Or ceremony, footballer is becoming a sustainable job to live with, the referees are getting considered, women football is getting out of the dust. He's the man that football needed. But i don't understand at all this horrific decision he took to not show the game to his people and that is add to the terrible managment of AndrÃ© Onana situation. Maybe there will be updates who'll make us look clear on who is to blame about that catastrpohe, but here I am, trying to convert all my frustration in a certainly laughable english to nice people like you who have their head more on Chelsea's loss than a friendly game not broadcasted.

There is no sense to this strategy, no sign of it ever working. Boehly went to the market like a 10 year old with a grand to spend in a shopping centre and just bought everything he could but nothing he needed. When you look up ""buyer's remorse"" in the dictionary there should be a picture of Boehly.

They bought some good players no doubt, but there's no overarching philosophy that ties it all together. There's just a bunch of young players that aren't used to losing, losing.

â‚¬210m spent on DMs in a single window, why? You sure you need depth when you aren't in Europe? Nicholas Jackson was a striker for all of 6 months, why is he the only out &amp; out striker at the club? At least Lakaka can hit a ball. What was the point in the Mudryk purchase? At â‚¬70m he's making Pepe look like reasonable business ffs.

Young players are all well &amp; good, but their improvement isn't linear. Sometimes they crash and burn, quite often their attitude surpasses their talent and sometimes injuries wittle away until there's nothing left.

And they're all on 8 year contracts, because Boehly has figured out something no one else has? In this day and age PL clubs either sell to a rival or sell for a loss unless Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern or PSG come knocking- and Bayern are difficult to fleece &amp; Barcelona are fucking broke. The market isn't what it was 10 years ago, and I promise you that Chelsea fans will start listing 8 or so players as deadwood very soon.

The truth is they deserve to be 10th, and the revenue will start to decline even further as the club becomes more and more of an embarrassment.

But it's oddly fitting really. Roman Abramovich saved Chelsea from financial ruin, so it makes sense their next owner is hell bent on sending them back from whence they came.

16648,"> and you're telling me he should get it ahead of the likes of Maddison and Foden?

Yes, because Maddison and Foden are attacking midfielders.

Jones should be in the squad because he players in a role that would work well with Rice and Bellingham given he's more of a box to box player who is very good in possession. He's also only 22 which means there is plenty of time for him to develop chemistry with his midfield partners whereas Ward-Prowse (who I think should be in the squad anyway) is 29.

> Not saying there's no place for Jones in the squad at all but England are absolutely stacked at midfield.

We've got two nailed on starters but the third spot is a genuine issue.

Shoehorning in pure water carriers like Henderson for â€œbalanceâ€ when any half decent coach would make that midfield of genuinely world class players work, is such a weird English trait we have.

16680,"Because Bellingham isn't an 8 anymore. Getting him closer to goal is how you get the most out of him. Just because he can play deeper doesn't mean he should, his best play for two seasons now has been with attacking freedom, which he just won't have next to Foden/Maddison.


Then you have to account for him not being a great deep build up player anyway. Stones isn't going to play that kind of role at international level, TAA isn't going to start at RB anymore and Kane dropping isn't the same as replacing deeper build up + it's actually another reason to play Bellingham as an advanced midfielder since he can use the space Kane creates.

Could Guardiola coach that midfield? Of course but at international level you are much better off with solidity of increased numbers and England really lack control from deep anyway. Another player next to him also helps Rice in build up and lets him actually drive forward with the ball which he does well. If the choice is Henderson then of course not but I don't think Foden is a good fit either",23,0
16681,"I agree with you in principle but not in practice 

Let's say we want to get the most out of Bellingham so play him as the 10 (generally, everyone here isn't a perfect analogy of the traditional roles)

Rice plays as the 6, some of what he does best is a license to drive the ball forward with a run. So now we need another balanced option in midfield to compliment those 2

Who do you pick? No Gallagher, Foden, Maddison they're the 3 who deserve to play the most. Then you start looking at maybe Eze, Mount (if he ever remember how to play football), Curtis Jones? 

I don't think any of those options really fit. The only ones I'd say fit the roles on paper are Henderson who is well past it and Phillips who doesn't play. Unless you want to get more creative and use Trent as a nominal midfielder and have it play 8

I think it's not to the perfect strengths of Jude, but the best midfield we can do is Rice 6, Jude 8, Foden 10",1,0
16682,"Why does Curtis Jones not fit? Reliable on the ball, good defensively and can progress it well without giving up anything physically. What makes Henderson a better fit than that? Ditto for Phillips at this point.

TAA can also be a good fit if creativity is what you want to get out of the position and you can ask him to play deeper and give Bellingham freedom to roam without losing structure. So that can be a dual 6 set up that gives Rice more freedom or a deeper lying 8. You don't need to compromise the strengths with Foden in there",1,0
16683,"I just think Jones isn't as balanced as I'd like. Keep in mind I don't watch a lot of Liverpool so I might not even be correct, but I just don't see the defensive side of his game being good enough. 

You'd be asking Rice to carry a lot of the defensive work and negate what I think sets him above from other top 6's which is his driving with the ball (leaving a hole behind him I don't think Jones fills well enough) for us at Arsenal, Rice is also winning the ball back 30 yards from the opposition goal and I don't know if he'd be allowed that freedom for England with that midfield 

Personally I like the Rice Bellingham Foden midfield the best, after that my favourite is probably Rice TAA Bellingham

But I think, whilst definitely overblown, Trent isn't the greatest defensive or physical player and he'd be our most creative but I wonder if we could get overrun a bit",0,0
16684,"Jones is definitely the most balanced of the 3 (TAA/Foden) because he can pretty much be plugged into different midfield roles. He was actually the 6 for the U-21s last year when the won the Euros and when Robertson was playing earlier this season he was often a de facto LB in possession. His defensive work and pressing are big strengths of his and if anything he fills the gap for Rice driving forward better than the other options (maybe Lewis being the next most obvious choice).

The actual issue with Jones would be creativity imo which is why I think TAA needs to be tried there first since he makes up for Rice and Bellingham's passing limitations more than anyone else. Jones is also yet another progresser by dribble which would make the entire midfield like that. But he is much better defensively than Henderson has been in the past 2 years or so and is a very do the job the manager wants kind of player",2,0
16685,"That's fair then, wasn't aware of that with Jones. I thought he'd be not defensively amazing and also not as good creatively as Foden 

This isn't perfect and don't at all think it's set in stone, but if you were to assign players a rating of how good that are in that role 

Say, rice(6) 8/10, Jude (8) 8/10, Foden(10) 8/10

Your midfield is a 24/30

Rice(6) 8/10, jones(8) 6/10, Jude(10) 9/10

Midfield is now 23/30

These number are just totally made up off the top of my head with 0 thought and were done specifically to make the lower one worse

17590,"How Messi was discovered by AFA, by Elias Perugino, 2006: 

*If it weren't for a magazine, Argentina probably wouldn't have discovered its greatest asset for this World Cup.*

Now it's very easy to say what Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Federation, stated about a month ago: ""I'm going to Germany with the same feeling I had in the 1986 World Cup because today Argentina has a player who makes the difference; Lionel Messi."" Now it's easy to praise the qualities of the Barcelona boy and imagine him among the stars of the World Cup. Now it's easy to describe what everyone sees him doing with the complicity of Eto'o and Ronaldinho: the unpredictable left leg, the natural ability to dribble past defenders, and the acceleration that not even Fernando Alonso can achieve with his Renault. Now it's easy, but the time has come for the football world to know a little secret: two and a half years ago, nobody in Argentina knew about Messi's existence.

Lionel was unknown to fans, officials, journalists, and, more importantly, to the national team coaching staff. It was the El GrÃ¡fico magazine that discovered him by chance. In the midst of an investigation into how Europeans detect and bring early talents from South America, a journalist from the magazine, Marcelo Orlandini, was impressed by the testimonials about Messi.

First, he spoke with Enrique Dominguez, the father of SebÃ¡, the current Corinthians defender: ""The great Argentine phenomenon was taken by Barcelona. His name is Lionel Messi. I coached him in the youth categories of Newell's in 1999. But I met him at seven years old, in a football school. The kid could do things that defied the laws of physics; like Maradona."" For a journalist who had never heard of Messi, he released this phrase: ""Like Maradona."" The reporter then called Carles Rexach, coordinator of Barcelona's youth categories and former teammate of Maradona in the Catalan team. ""Messi? I see that news travels fast. I signed him in 30 seconds; he caught my attention a lot. In my 40 years of football, I had never seen anything like it. Out of five goal situations, he converts four. And he has exceptional skill. It reminded me of the best Maradona. I signed his first contract, symbolically, on a napkin: I wanted to hire him as soon as possible, couldn't let him slip away,"" said the official.

When the reporter told the magazine director that he had found the ""new Maradona,"" he received an ironic response. And no wonder: it was the 30th ""new Maradona"" since the end of Diego's career. To conclude his investigations, the journalist then called Hugo Tocalli, who was the coach of the Argentine youth teams and now assists JosÃ© Pekerman in the senior team. The dialogue went as follows:

â€” Hugo, do you know the kid Messi?
â€” Who?!
â€” Lionel Messi, an Argentine kid who is in Barcelona.
â€” Ah, yes, yes! We are keeping an eye on him.

Later, the journalist would confirm his prediction: Tocalli didn't know Messi; he had said yes just to get out of an awkward situation. ""If Tocalli doesn't know him, he can't be that good,"" thought the El GrÃ¡fico director. The reporter didn't give up. He got Messi's father Jorge's phone number and convinced him to send some videos of his son to the magazine's editorial team. A week later, neither the reporter nor the director could believe what they saw: a little boy with Barcelona's shirt left five or six opponents in his wake and scored fantastic, Maradona-like goals. There were no more doubts: Messi was a phenomenon.

Convinced, El GrÃ¡fico published the article about the ""new Maradona."" And the Argentine Federation did not stand idly by. A cunning fox, Grondona acted quickly and organized a friendly match for the U20 national team against Paraguay just to make Messi play. ""Fill out the official form to send to FIFA,"" ordered the strongman of the AFA, thwarting Spain's intentions to naturalize Messi as a Spanish player.

Later, details of Messi's story came to light. At the age of 11, hormonal problems that hindered his growth were detected. This prevented his bone development. For years, he had to take injections every night. The treatment cost $900 per month, and his parents couldn't afford it. Newell's refused to pay, and River Plate, the club that tested Messi, also declined. The player's father wrote to relatives in the Spanish city of LÃ©rida and traveled there to try his luck amid Argentina's severe economic crisis. In Spain, he managed to get in touch with Barcelona, and the club agreed to sign the boy. Barcelona paid for the treatment.

Shortly afterward, details of the explosion came. His rapid growth, the title, the Golden Ball, and the Golden Boot of the U20 World Cup. The ""protection"" and advice from Ronaldinho at Barcelona. Praise from Maradona, who pointed to him as his successor. Now it's easy to say that Messi is Argentina's main weapon for the World Cup.",29,0

***FA Cup replays review***

Two shocks dominate the news this Wednesday, as the FA Cup 3rd round replays took place between yesterday and today.

The first involves the holders, Sunderland. At Roker Park, [they were beaten 1-0 by Carlisle](https://i.imgur.com/F6W7kUf.png) with a Dennis Martin goal. The Rokerites manager, Bob Stokoe, was angry about the choice of referees, as they were from the North East. The second shock is the one of West Ham, who were humbled [2-1 by Third Division Hereford](https://i.imgur.com/7G6xfhN.jpg). In scenes like the one in 1972 against Newcastle, the Bulls overcame Clyde Best's opening goal with a penalty scored by Tommy Naylor and a second goal courtesy of Alan Jones. West Ham's season goes from bad to worse after this defeat.

Sadly, the non-League sides in contention today went out - Hendon chose Watford's Vicarage Road as their home ground, and [the fairytale ended here](https://i.imgur.com/vnx3bHg.png): goals from Ken Hibbitt, Malcolm MacDonald, John Tudor and Terry MacDermott put and end to Hendon's run in the tournament. The same can be said of Boston, [who were thrashed 6-1 against Derby](https://i.imgur.com/W6yptT1.png) \- a match in which Archie Gemmill scored a hat-trick. Liverpool also avoided a scalp at Fourth Division Doncaster - [an easy 2-0 win was enough](https://i.imgur.com/pYGVXfi.png), in a match [marred by violence](https://i.imgur.com/2suPsNi.png). The all Division One match between leaders [Leeds and Wolves](https://i.imgur.com/tgO0PJp.png) had controversy as well: Wolves' manager Bill McGarry claimed Mick Jones handed a ball in the dying seconds of the match - said Jones was the scorer of [the only goal of the match](https://i.imgur.com/j9PTzMu.png), qualifying Leeds into the next round.

As for the rest, Coventry City finally put an end to Sheffield Wednesday's ambitions ([3-1](https://i.imgur.com/soODEQD.png)) while Luton did the same against Division Three Port Vale ([4-2](https://i.imgur.com/R5z9UcE.png)). A Trevor Tainton goal was enough for [Bristol City to beat Hull](https://i.imgur.com/rm8bDf3.png) at Boothferry Park - a same fate for Bobby Kellard, whose goal helped [Portmouth beat Swindon](https://i.imgur.com/mHicFbG.png), while Scunthorpe needed less than a minute [to shock Millwall](https://i.imgur.com/4AXB5uK.jpg) at the Old Showgrounds. Finally, there will be another replay between Oldham and Cambridge, which [drew 3-3](https://i.imgur.com/jgjB1PU.png) in a highly entertaining match.

One match was postponed, however, as [QPR and Chelsea](https://i.imgur.com/dYqCad2.png) will play their replay next week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Elsewhere** \- rumour has it that a [swap](https://i.imgur.com/XhGie17.png) between Southampton's Mick Channon and Chelsea's Peter Osgood may be on the cards.

It's just a weird comparison because he doesn't do any of the things that make Kane so special, even to a lesser level.

He's had one 'good' Premier League season at the age of 26 and I'm not going down the FIFA/FM route of saying his career is over already but expecting huge progression at this point would be a massive gamble. His strengths are far more suited to a team that isn't dominant, hence mid-table being where I'd rate him.

Toney is genuinely great at holding up play. Even better than Kane for me. Although Toney doesnt possess anywhere near the passing ability Kane does.

Kane also wouldnt be as good without someone like a Son stretching the opposition when he is dropping deep and Toney doesnt have that (I feel Mbeumo plays deeper than Toney)

Toney is also faster than Kane and provides a much bigger in-behind threat as well as a better aerial presence. I have never seen anybody trouble Matip and VVD in the air like Toney did. VVD would have the most comfortable games vs Kane when it came to 1v1 duels",3,0

I don't actually disagree with the rest of your comment, quoted part below aside, I just think they support my argument that he wouldn't look as good in a dominant team but it's fine to disagree on that and I don't doubt we'll get a chance to find out in the future.

> Kane is hardly a good dribbler so I am not sure this is even something worth comparing. Even if Toney is worse, he cant be much worse.

I do think you are underrating what Kane can do with the ball at his feet when he picks it up deep. I'm not talking about Eden Hazard style dribbling but he drives at players with the ball very well, he's got the strength to go shoulder to shoulder with them and the guile, shall we call it, to win free kicks when he can't otherwise fashion a chance from it.",4,0

When I say Kane-lite, I'm not saying exact playstyle but his level of completeness. But I still think you're massively downplaying how good his passing is, it's not Kane level but I rate it. He operates as both an on the defenders shoulder type of attacker, and as a target man/link up striker. He's very strong, pretty quick, technically sound, and a good finisher.",2,0
17845,"I don't think he fits at Liverpool and Arsenal at all which is part of the problem, his skill set does not mesh with how the top teams want to play. If you just take Jesus out of the Arsenal team and replace him with Toney I think they get significantly worse. Liverpool is less clear but he doesn't suit the model of any successful central forward they've had lately. I don't rate him higher than Watkins and Isak and other clubs have forwards with what I would consider a higher ceiling that they don't want to restrict.

> Ability wise who would you say are his peers in the league?

Solanke. Callum Wilson. Would have said Calvert-Lewin if he had shown any signs of staying fit and getting back to his pre-injury levels. With Toney having 8 months off maybe that's not a bad comparison though, see how he comes back.",5,0
17846,"That's interesting be cause I couldn't disagree more with your first point. Repeating myself but it's why I likened him to Kane...I think he has so many faucets to his game that I think with an adaptation period he could genuinely suit every team in the league. With no exaggeration I think he'd do absolutely everything Arteta wants form Havertz (when he plays up top) better, and I think his style works perfectly as a foil to someone like Salah. i won't go as far as I did with Havertz, but I think with him you get the idea of what Klopp wants with Nunez as a 9.

Take back what I said about you not watching him, but I think we're miles away from what we each see in him. To me saying someone like DCL is his peer (even pre injury) is mad to me

E: one thing I do agree with is Kane is a very underrated dribbler. As you say not in the sense that he's a winger who will leave his defender looking silly, but he always seems to be able to navigate his way out of a situation where it ;looks like he has no choice but to lose it.",7,0

DCL pre injury had a couple of seasons that weren't far off of Toney's Premier League seasons at a much younger age. His development has, unfortunately for him, been wrecked by injuries but before he got injured he was one to look out for in my opinion. Comparing him to Toney now was probably a bit churlish though, I'll give you that.

17981,"Konate is always injured. He has failed to play in more than 50% of league games in his first 2 seasons with Liverpool (in his last RB season he made 14 league appearances, so that's 3 seasons in a row). Liverpool bought him for EUR35 mil, his Transfermarkt value went as high as 45 mil in 2019, and since he's always injured they've pulled it back to 38 mil. That figure is probably a bit low but I think it's consistent. To give a bit of context, Upamecano was worth EUR30 mil when Konate was valued at 45mil. Upamecano has had his fair share of injuries but nothing like Konate (he has played more than 80% of league games in 5 of his last 6 seasons). He is now worth EUR60 mil according to Transfermarkt. Without the injuries Konate would be valued at EUR75-90 mil. Konate is having a good, injury free season. If he keeps that up I think he will be valued at EUR60-70 mil this time next year (now, I dare you to bet money on Konate remaining injury free lol).

The difference between Gvardiol and Saliba is very small (80 mil vs. 75 mil). You say Saliba was fantastic last season as if Gvardiol wasn't one of the best CBs at the World Cup. Gvardiol also had a fantastic season at RB. Gvardiol hasn't been shot the lights out at City, but he was amazing for RB and Croatia just 6 months ago.

I guess mine would be that managers should be booked more for leaving their technical areas. Without going full Richard Keys, it is crazy to see managers just roaming so close to the pitch.

Maybe you're not going to buy a new shirt every single season for 10 seasons in a row, but if you're the type of person who buys a new shirt relatively frequently then you're more likely to feel that urge when there's 3 new kits every season to choose from than if the team kept the same 2-3 kits for 2-3 seasons.",1,0

>Â You've bought a ticket to see Inter Miami and you want to watch Messi play, that's how football works


In 99.9% of situations, yes, but surely you can understand the difference here? Like, answer my question, how many tickets would have been sold for this match if instead of Inter Miami, it was literally a pub team with Messi on their team? I doubt there'd be a noticeable difference.Â 


>Â I'm sure when Messi was at PSG or Barca people would fly in from all over the world not giving a shit about the club but specifically to watch Messi.Â 


But 1) that's top tier teams, if Messi isn't playing you still get to see Neymar, or Iniesta, or whoever (in their primes), and 2) you know this match was set up **purely** as a ""come see the GOAT"" money spinner. This is barely even ""I hope Messi plays"" its ""the only reason more than a handful of people are there is Messi""Â 


If you pay to go to the Nou camp, they haven't set that match up **purely** to take your money on the understanding you'd see MessiÂ ",1,1
19016,"So you'll be satisfied with iniesta in his prime but not the wailers, get a load of this guyâ€¦

I hear what you're saying about how nobody would go if it wasn't to try and see Messi, and it sucks if inter Miami or the organizers screwed you with false advertising- but surely you also see what I'm saying that's not how football works. You can say oh you get to see the rest of the team but to an Argentinian Messi super fan who flys halfway across the world to watch PSG then messi is injured (and Neymar goes to a party) I bet he would disagree with you, he still wouldn't think Messi owes him a speech or a refund though.",2,0
19017,"Â¹>Â Argentinian Messi super fan who flys halfway across the world to watch PSG then messi is injuredÂ 


That would suck, but the difference is IMO, that if you get a ticket to PSG vs Auxerre, or Barca vs Betis, you're *expecting* Messi to play, but the point of the match is the match itself.Â 


Whereas literally the only point of this match was ""for people in Hong Kong to see Messi."" That's it. That's the only reason.Â Â 


Â If Messi never signed for Miami, this match doesn't even exist does it? Whereas if he never played for PSG or Barca, those matches would still have gone ahead.Â

I mean, it's pretty much how Pele toured the world with Santos. It wasn't for anyone other than Pele. It wasn't ""let's go see my local team play Santos"" it was ""let's go see the GOAT"".Â

Also, they're not exactly mad at Messi for not playing, but no effort of communication was made before and during the game, unlike Ronaldo's case during the Saudi game.

The sharp increase in ticket prices is reasonably connected to Messi's presence in the consumer's eyes. A business should carry more weight of responsibility than a consumer.

For the match in Hong Kong on Sunday, while fans would be disappointed but they could still be understandable if you came upfront before the match and told them Messi and Suarez were injured and could not play. But the club didn't. It stayed silent for the whole match and let the audience hold their hopes high until the very end and disappoint them. After the match, when requested to meet fans at the pitch having not played the game, Messi just hid behind his teammates, neither him nor Beckham spoke a word. Messi you were injured but you could still walk and speak right? Why not at least greet the fans who came from miles away? In addition to the crazy ticket prices, I have read a new report that a family had brought their 86 years old father to the stadium (from the elderly home even wearing adult diaper) to watch the match, and he was extremely frustrated afterwards. As someone who advertised themself as family man, Messi and Bechham have eternally lost my respect.  Not matter how good your skills are or what titles you have earned, as to me you guys are just extremely greedy and lack the basic manners to be responsible individuals.â€¬ Don't excuse him for being just an introvert, that is the minimum for being a man.

Even more disappointed after the press conference in Japan today. Messi and the club didn't even have the decency to apologise in front of his Hong Kong fans but just left and speak in Japan instead. The ones you should be addressing live in Hong Kong not Japan!!! How could you treat your fans including elderly who are in the autumn of their lives like that!? I thought saying sorry is a basic manner we learnt since young. Definitely not a case for Messi and the club.

And how about Suarez? He did warm up during the match but didn't take part. Is the club that greedy which discriminated Hong Kong as it is a small place? If so why come to Hong Kong in the first place? Just don't take the money.

Could you understand the anger and frustration of Hong Kong people, in particular those who have bought their old parents to the stadium to create possibly maybe some of the last few sharing memories? I have a father at old age and I feel for them.

The lack of proper response given the fact that fans were charged hundreds of dollars just not to see the main man play is disappointing - especially comparing to how CR7 handled the Al Nasser China tour, his apology speech may be over the top but he at least is sincere.

I really don't care about the plight of the ""fans"" here. You paid a bunch if money for a football match. You got a football match. Too bad that Messi, the figure on which Inter Miami's ENTIRE SEASON in MLS and CONCACAF Champions league rest (the team probably a fringe playoff seed otherwise) didn't play in what is a friendly. For the club there are more important games full stop.

Honestly my sympathies are with the regular players on Inter Miami. I'm sure in some ways this is a once in a life time experience for these lads but the kind of schedule they are being pressed to play, the greuling travel right before the season... All to be booed by a bunch of ""fans"" who couldn't even tell you which team is playing... Just that it's Messi. ""Fans"" who will pack each fixture, even your home ones who care nothing for you or at least your team but will stream out once the golden child is subbed off in the 65th minute. To know you are part of this gross circus side-show celebrating... Frankly a has been (yes Messi is still good but not great). A circus that is going to continue into the season... Into the games that actually count, the games where your performance will have a real impact on the trajectory of your career.
